### Hi! This is Losar.


I am a freshman computer science student who is currently learning to code. My goal at this stage is to become familiar with GitHub and basic programming, so that I can share my learning journey and hopefully inspire others. While I recognize that I may not yet be an expert, I know that making mistakes is simply a part of the learning process.

I have a variety of personal interests, including mathematics, games, music, literature, and languages. I enjoy getting lost in  the vast and imaginative worlds created by humans, and I have always known that this is what I wanted to do when I grow up.

#### I am particularly interested in various topics and fields, which include:

   - Computational sciences and other computer science-related subjects
   - Cryptography, as well as mathematical modeling and analysis
   - Biology, particularly the study of life and its various forms and ecology
   - Finance, especially the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) and economics in general.

#### I am currently working on learning several materials related to computer science, including:

   - Basic programming concepts in Python
   - Various programming languages and their respective capabilities
   - Writing and documenting using Markdown and LaTeX
   - Laying the foundation for dynamic programming
   - Laying a solid foundation in Mathematics
